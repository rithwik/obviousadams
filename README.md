# Obvious Adams

_Obvious Adams_ is a classic business parable published in 1916. PDFs are publicly available but I couldn't find a well-formatted ebook. So I generated one.

The text is in `obvious.md`. The cover image was created using Canva. The EPUB was generated using pandoc.

You can regenerate the EPUB using the command: `pandoc obvious.md -o obvious.epub`, or other file types by changing the extension.
